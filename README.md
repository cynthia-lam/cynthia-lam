### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




- ðŸ”­ My name is Cynthia, I have a background in education and biomedical engineering
- ðŸ‘¯ I just graduated from the Web Development program at Lighthouse Labs, thanks to a full scholarship from IDRF's Women in Tech program, where I was the valedictorian of my cohort 
- âš¡ Fun fact - I love bouldering, calisthenics, and I'm learning to tattoo in my spare time (when I'm not coding!)
