### Hi there 👋




- 🔭 My name is Cynthia, I have a background in biomedical engineering
- 👯 I graduated from the Web Development program at Lighthouse Labs, thanks to a full scholarship from IDRF's Women in Tech program, where I was the valedictorian of my cohort 
- ⚡ Fun fact - I love bouldering, calisthenics, and I'm learning to tattoo in my spare time (when I'm not coding!)
