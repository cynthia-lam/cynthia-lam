### Hi there ğŸ‘‹




- ğŸ”­ My name is Cynthia and I'm a graduate student studying biomedical engineering.

- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any suggestions for beginner to intermediate projects to help me learn the languages. 
- ğŸ“« I'm open to internships! I am a fast learner and an adaptive worker. I thrive in supportive and challenging environments.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
